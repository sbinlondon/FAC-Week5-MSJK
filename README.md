## User story

* I can enter a term to search
* This term will be sent to two news sites
* I will receive the top 3-5 articles from each site based on my search term
* I will be able to read the headline, author, date published, and see the hero image on the page
* I will be able to click a link to read the full article

## Stretch goals

* I can choose two news sites to compare from a list of top UK, US, and EU news sites
* If I search for 'Trump' or 'Brexit', the website turns bright red to discourage me

## How it all went down

### Day 1 

* Kate set up the repo with empty files, and Heroku
* Jessie set up ES Lint, and promptly turned it off
* Jessie and Kate set up npm
* Michael and Sangita set up Travis and CodeCov
* Everyone drew a very basic software architecture
* Michael and Sangita worked on building the server
* Michael and Sangita wrote lots of tests
* Michael got worried about 99% coverage, but it's actually BRILLIANT
* Jessie and Kate built the frontend skeleton (HTML and CSS)
* Jessie and Kate worked on inserting data into the DOM
* Jessie and Kate started the API response parser
